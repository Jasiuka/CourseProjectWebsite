HTML/CSS course website project

This website design and whole concept is not mine. It's just copy of HTML/CSS course project, except some things were done by me and code is a bit different than course teacher code. Link to the course https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=437398

- This was my first course of learning HTML & CSS, it was great and very informative course, it was not just how to develop web site, but also how to design it and what rules follow to make web sites look proffesional. I learned a lot while doing this course and really had fun, also in this last project I just did not watched lecture and write code with teacher, but before watching every lecture, I tried to copy everything by my self just looking at already made website, later watched that lecture and fixed or added things that I missed, so my code is a more messier than teacher's code, but all things work as should.
